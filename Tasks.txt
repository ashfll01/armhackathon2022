 - Make the basic encoding and decoding work (as a test). The process is descibed here:
    https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/5078 (Sigve doing this atm.)
    
 - Look at the implementation (link above) and compare it with the info in the test vectors 
   (found here: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9180#ref-TestVectors).
   We want to figure out what variables we need to change in the implementation/what info we need from the test 
   vectors to make the encoding match the encoding used to generate the values in the test vectors. 
   
 - Write down all the relevant info from the test vectors that we need to do the tests. The previous step 
   has to be done fist.
   
 - Make the encoding and decoding algorithm dynamic so that we can just feed any relevant information from
   the test vectors as varibales when running the script. 
   
 - Run multiple test vectors and check that the encoded and decode message matches the information in the test 
   vectors.
