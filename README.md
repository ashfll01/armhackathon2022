## Project #1: Test Vectors for Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE)

HPKE defines a variant of a public key encryption scheme of plaintext for a recipient public key. HPKE is defined in [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9180) and an implementation can be found in [https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/5078](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/pull/5078). The HPKE comes with a number of test vectors, which can be used to verify the correctness of an implementation.

The goal of the project is to use test vectors to test the HPKE implementation.
